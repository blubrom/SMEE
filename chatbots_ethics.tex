\begin{frame}{What problem(s) are chatbots trying to solve? \footnote{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827020300062}}
\begin{block}{Automate tasks that imply human interaction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shopping, booking a room, administrative tasks \dots
        \item Conversation when no human is available
            \begin{itemize}
                \item replace a deceased loved one \footnote{https://www.cnet.com/culture/hereafter-ai-lets-you-talk-with-your-dead-loved-ones-through-a-chatbot/}
                \item replace a teacher to be able to ask questions about the course/learn anytime and anywhere you want
                \item Replace a doctor for people that have trouble talking to a doctor
                \vdots
            \end{itemize}
        \item query answering (Siri, Alexa, Cortana, \dots)
        \item personalised recommandations
    \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Pros}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item cost effective: Cheaper than paying humans to do the same tasks
        \item availability: The chatbots can be used anywhere and at anytime
        \item Ease of use: You communicate in natural language
        \item If done carefully could be usefull for some people in the medical domain
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cons}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple security issues
        \begin{itemize}
            \item working with personnal data
            \item Could be the target of many attacks (for instance Cortana installing and  malicious software)
            \item If learning from interactions with users, can be manipulated (Example of the Tay chatbot that interacted on twitter and was manipulated by far rights accounts)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Replaces humans in places where human are more suited to help (Social services where you cannot contact a human)
        \item Troubles with processing users intent $\rightarrow$ can cause missunderstandings
        \item Risks of "Overprogramming" (see Illich, \emph{Tools for Conviviality})
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Frame Title}
    There is real optimism around chatbots and the ability to overcome the many cons this technology currently faces. \\
    No questions about the environmental impacts of the massive deployment of such technologies through IoT for instance
    \begin{block}{ADEME scenario}
    Chatobts are placing themselves in the fourth scenario : Restoration Gamble \\
    More consumption and little questionning about possibly negative impacts
    \end{block}
